1. What is DriverEntry

It is the driver's entry as its name suggest.
Let's see the code in source.c

NTSTATUS DriverEntry(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath)
{
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject);
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RegistryPath);


	DbgPrintEx(DPFLTR_IHVDRIVER_ID, 0, "Hello Driver");

	DriverObject->DriverUnload = DriverUnload;


	return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}


You can find 'UNREFERENCE_PARAMETER()'
this must be used unless you use the function's parameters. otherwise, an error occurs during the build process.
but when using parameter, using B doesn't cause an error

I used the DbgPrintEx(). but you can use KdPrint() it is similar.
And you can't see the text int the usual way. you must install the tool 'DbgView'  

finally, return STATUS_SUCCESS
it is defined by 
#define STATUS_SUCCESS                   ((NTSTATUS)0x00000000L)    // ntsubauth
