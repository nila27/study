NTSTATUS ObRegisterCallbacks(_In_ POB_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION CallbackRegistration, _Outptr_ PVOIOD *RegistrationHandle);

Prior to registration, an OB_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION structure must be initialized, which provides teh necessary details about what the driver is registering for.
The RegistrationHandle is the return value upon a successful registartion, which is just an opaque pointer used for unregistration by calling obUnregisterCallbacks.

Let's see OB_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION

this is define in wdm.h

typedef struct _OB_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION {
    _In_ USHORT                     Version;
    _In_ USHORT                     OperationRegistrationCount;
    _In_ UNICODE_STRING             Altitude;
    _In_ PVOID                      RegistrationContext;
    _In_ OB_OPERATION_REGISTRATION  *OperationRegistration;
} OB_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION, *POB_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION;

Version is a just a constant that must be set to OB_FLT_REGISTRATION_VERSION(
